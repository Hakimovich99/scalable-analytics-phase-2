### Important note

The data is not being pushed on the git, as github does not tolerate more the 25MB per file (the full data is arround 88MB).

Please run the preprocess notebook to renegerate the CSV file used in the project. The notebook is able to download the data and structured the project. Please also use the docker image. As we are parallelising the query process, there is a known bug on ARM macs which doesn't allow spark nodes to make external requests.

In case your having troubles getting the files, please do not hesitate to reach out to us as we have put a lot of effort in this work.

Thank you for your comprehension,

Group 5
